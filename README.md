## Project Overview
The **AI Loan Approval & Risk Assessment System** is designed to transform the traditional loan approval process by leveraging advanced AI-driven analytics. This innovative system evaluates loan eligibility by calculating credit scores and assessing financial risks using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques, ensuring decisions are both accurate and data-driven.

## Team Information
- **Team Name**: CodeZilla  
- **Institute**: Vivekanand Education Society’s Institute of Technology  

## System Workflow
1. **AI-Driven Credit Scoring**: The system employs specialized AI agents to compute credit scores using a **vector RAG-based approach**.
2. **Probability Estimation**: Financial parameters are analyzed by the AI to predict the likelihood of loan approval.
3. **Seamless API Integration**: Real-time assessments are powered by **OpenAI 4o** and **Gemini 1.5 Flash**, ensuring smooth operations.

## Core Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified input fields allow users to enter financial details effortlessly.
- **AI-Powered Credit Score Calculation**: Utilizes **RAG models** to evaluate creditworthiness with precision.
- **Loan Approval Prediction**: Considers multiple factors to estimate the probability of loan approval.
- **Intuitive Visualization**: Results are presented in a clear and structured format for easy understanding.

## Key Innovation
The system’s **Credit Score RAG container** democratizes financial assessments, enabling individuals **without financial expertise** to comprehend their credit standing. This promotes financial inclusion and accessibility, empowering users to make informed decisions.

## Development Challenges
During the development phase, the team encountered several challenges:
1. **Optimization of AI Workflow**: Initial attempts using Chain-of-Thought (COT) reasoning resulted in inconsistencies, necessitating refinements in the workflow.
2. **API Endpoint Identification**: Identifying suitable endpoints for seamless UI functionality required significant redesign efforts.

## Mentorship Advancements
In the guidamce round, we were suggested to not implement COT, an algorithm we were going with that was not working properly with the uptiq workbench. Following the suggestion, we drew our focus to another implementation and delivered the objectives in a much more efficient manner using a RAG container.

## Final Breakthrough
After implementing the suggestions, we completed our AI agentic pipeline and integrated a custom agentic layout in uptiq ai. The video of which is available in this repository.

## Future Enhancements
The project envisions several improvements to enhance its capabilities:
- **Advanced AI Decision-Making**: Incorporate **machine learning-driven risk analysis and fraud detection**.
- **Expanded API Support**: Integrate with a broader range of **financial service providers**.
- **Self-Learning Mechanism**: Enable the AI to adapt and refine its credit scoring models over time.
- **Explainability in AI Decisions**: Provide users with **transparent insights** into the rationale behind approval decisions.
- **Scalability for Global Markets**: Tailor AI models to comply with **diverse financial regulations** across regions.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Further improve the **custom widget’s interactivity** for a seamless user journey.

## Challenges Faced

### 1. Editing Issues in JavaScript Code  
The team faced persistent **network errors** while modifying JavaScript code within the project files. This hindered iterative development and led to the abandonment of the **chain-of-thought reasoning approach** initially planned for the project.

### 2. API Limitations for Uptiq.ai  
The absence of a public **API for Uptiq.ai** posed a significant challenge. The original **UI design had to be reworked**, as integrating the frontend with the AI agent became impractical without a reliable API. This forced the team to rethink and adapt their implementation strategy.
