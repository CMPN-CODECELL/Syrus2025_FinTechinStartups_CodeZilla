## Challenges Faced

### 1. Editing Issues in JS Code  
We encountered persistent **network errors** when attempting to modify JavaScript code within the project files. This made it difficult to iterate on our initial approach, leading us to **scrap the chain-of-thought idea** for the project.

### 2. API Limitations for Uptiq.ai  
Our original **UI design had to be abandoned** due to the unavailability of a public **API for Uptiq.ai**. Without a reliable API, integrating our frontend with the agent we were building became unfeasible, forcing us to reconsider our implementation strategy.
